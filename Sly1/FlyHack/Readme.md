**Installation:**  
Copy the .pnach file into your PCSX2 cheats folder(in root directory of PCSX2 installation by default)

**Usage:**  
When you have the decoy move unlocked and selected(renamed to Fly), when you press the jump button you will be able to fly around. You can still use the decoy move, but flight is only enabled with it selected, so that you can still play normally and just switch on flight when necessary. Have fun!
